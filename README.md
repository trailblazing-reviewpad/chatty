# chatty

This is an experimental Go project to play with AI chat agents using LLMs.

I have seen some projects that charge for people to use LLMs as basic chat agents on Slack.

I believe that people should be able to use these agents for free so that the technology can be improved.

## First version


Integrate a basic AI agent using OpenAI API to Discord and Slack.

This is will be a simple CLI tool that will allow you to connect to a Discord or Slack channel and have a bot respond to messages.
